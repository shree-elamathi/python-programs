Jack has been interested in numerology for a while and has learned how to calculate a lucky number for a given
word using the rules below:

Each alphabet in the word has an ASCII value (where 'A' = 65, 'B' = 66, ..., 'Z' = 90, 'a' = 97, etc.).

Each letter in the word is assigned a 1-based index (i.e., the first letter has index 1, the second letter has
index 2, and so on).

The lucky number is calculated as follows:

Multiply each characterâ€™s ASCII value by its 1-based index.

Include this product in the sum only if either the index or the ASCII value (or both) are odd.
