'''
You are given two arrays with positive integers arr1 and arr2.
A prefix of a positive integer is an integer formed by one or more of its digits, starting from its leftmost digit.
For example, 123 is a prefix of the integer 12345, while 234 is not.
A common prefix of two integers a and b is an integer c, such that c is a prefix of both a and b. For example,
5655359 and 56554 have a common prefix 565 while 1223 and 43456 do not have a common prefix.
You need to find the length of the longest common prefix between all pairs of integers (x, y) such that x belongs to
arr1 and y belongs to arr2.
Return the length of the longest common prefix among all pairs. If no common prefix exists among them, return 0.
