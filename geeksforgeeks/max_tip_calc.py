'''
In a restaurant, two waiters, A and B, receive n orders per day, earning tips as per arrays arr[i] and brr[i]
respectively. If A takes the ith order, the tip is arr[i] rupees; if B takes it, the tip is brr[i] rupees.
To maximize total tips, they must distribute the orders such that:
A can handle at most x orders
B can handle at most y orders
Given that x + y â‰¥ n, all orders can be managed by either A or B. Return the maximum possible total tip after
processing all the orders.
